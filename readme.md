# üöß Rewrite in progress üöß

Version 1 of DemoMan is feature-complete and available for download.
Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/DemomanApp/DemoMan/releases)
to download the latest executable,
and the [v1 branch](https://github.com/DemomanApp/DemoMan/tree/v1)
of this repo for screenshots, features, and source code of version 1.

I'm currently working on version 2 of the app, rewritten from scratch with
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[Tauri](https://tauri.app/), and
[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/).
This version will have many exciting features that were
not feasible to implement in version 1.

Preview builds of version 2 are already available under the releases page on GitHub.
