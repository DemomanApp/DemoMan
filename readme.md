# What is a demo manager and why do I need one?

Do you have hundreds of demos lying around, with no convenient way to know what happens in each one?
DemoMan extracts lots of information about your demos, and makes them easily searchable.
It also helps you organize your demos, and allows you to manage bookmarks.

# ‚ú® Features

- Display/edit bookmarks
- Display events from a demo (chat, killfeed, airshots, ...)
- Display scoreboard, with per-round stats for each player
- Play demo in TF2 with one click
- Organize your demos with tags
